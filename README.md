# My .vim directory

This is just the contents of my .vim that I keep synchronized on my computers.

Decided to make this after reading http://statico.github.com/vim.html and http://statico.github.com/vim2.html.
and wanting add some standard things to my vim configuration that wouldn't work only with a synchronized .vimrc.
